         <span class="font-bold text-lg -tracking-wide ">His saga is the enterpreneurial creation myth</span> writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded <br /> Apple in his parents' in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in <br /> 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, and built it into the world's most valuable company.<br /> Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, <br /> phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of <br /> America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was <br /> a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied <br /> imagination to technology and business.
